# Sewing Database

#### Idea
This project stemmed from my hobby of sewing. I have a lot of 
sewing patterns and wanted an easy way to store and search 
these patterns to find an appropriate pattern.

#### Process
I already had a clear picture of how I wanted this database 
to look - I needed easy-to-use functions, ability to add pictures 
to pattern files and ability to update the files as I sewed 
patterns. To make sure I didn't lose my progress and to put into 
practice skills I had recently learnt doing the CodeAcademy 
git and GitHub course, I created a repository on GitHub for this 
project and made sure I was making regular commits.

I then started with writing code to open, read and write 
to a CSV file. From here, I created functions in order to be 
able to add, search and update patterns within the database. 
I used tkinter to make the interface more user-friendly.

#### Learning
1. The biggest skill that I learnt throughout this process was using 
tkinter to develop user interfaces. I've previously done 
something similar using macros on Microsoft Excel but using 
python has been much easier in many ways. It was easier to code,
easier to layout in a nice way and easier to handle errors. I 
used labels, entry boxes, buttons and checkboxes to develop my user 
interfaces and implemented IntVar() to pull the variables from 
the interface into useable data within the code.

   
2. Not something I did this time, but something for future would 
be break up the different functions / interfaces into different 
files so that it looks nice and is easier to read. The code can 
get bigger quite quickly and it can be hard to keep track of 
where I was up to at times.

#### Challenges
+ Learning tkinter and error handling within this!

#### Future Work
It would be great to revisit this database in future when I have 
more skills in python. Ideally, this would be an online 
interface that wouldn't need to be opened in python to run. This 
would allow further flexibility in the application of the project 
as well as allow me to work on the design elements of the 
presentation more.

### Steps to Complete:
+ Being able to add patterns to the database - *done*
+ Checking if these patterns are already on the database - *done*
+ Adding multiple categories - *done*
+ Searching the database for patterns
+ Updating pattern information
+ Adding pictures to the pattern information
+ Selecting pattern category (ie. not just typing for error handling purposes) - *done*
