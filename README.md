# Sewing Database

#### Idea
This project stemmed from my hobby of sewing. I have a lot of 
sewing patterns and wanted an easy way to store and search 
these patterns to find an appropriate pattern.

### Steps to Complete:
+ Being able to add patterns to the database - *done*
+ Checking if these patterns are already on the database - *done*
+ Adding multiple categories
+ Searching the database for patterns
+ Updating pattern information
+ Adding pictures to the pattern information
